# Predict-EES

This repositary contains python codes and necessary files to republicate results in Fig. S30 to S43 of the manuscript "Predict Neuromuscular Performance in Human Epidural Electrical Stimulation".

The EMG peak-to-peak values collected from two participants are stored in 'Data/EMG data of P1(P2)' folder.

Run Visualization.ipynb to load the pretrined networks in 'Data/Torch models' folder and republicate the results.

Run Neural Network Training.ipynb to train new neural networks based on EMG peak-to-peak values and calculated activation matrices.
